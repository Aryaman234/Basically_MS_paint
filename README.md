<h1>Basically MS Paint</h1>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This will be a downsized version of MS paint. IT will include the basic functions such as draw,change color of brush, erase, erase all, etc. In addtion, it will include a function that will create a line of symmetry.</p>

<h2>Interaction</h2>
<p>My program allows user to draw whatever they want. It lets them explore their creativity. Since there is a line of symmetry function, users can make more symetrical shapes. This is useful because if you wanted to or draw a face or create blueprints for a building, this function would be perfect. </p>
